# stacked

## A stack-based language with a focus on functions and scripting.

Notes on the interpreter: it's currently written in JavaScript. The final product is intended to be written in C++, but that is some distance away. The syntax itself is not subject to much change hereafter, same with most functions.

The programs themselves are primarily intended to be readable yet writeable. That is, I intend the language to never force you to write boilerplate. That is, you should never have to do `public static main void function long asdf` to print a string.

An important note: I've focused more on the breadth of functions, and while I try to catch bugs, it's more than likely that bugs exist in the code. Please, open an issue if something seems out of the ordinary. I'll be more than happy to explain the language to you, so even if the issue just stems from misunderstanding, I will respond.
